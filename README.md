# SVSE5_PEC16_mount
PEC16 knob mount for DJDAO SVSE5 controller.

*I have not tested it since I don't have a SVSE5 controller.*

This is a small mounting piece that can be used on DJDAO SVSE5 controller. Both 3d print file and lasercut ready, however, lasercut file does not come with countersink holes so keep that in mind.

This is made for use of `PEC16-40XXF-N0024`, since I had it laying around on the table.
